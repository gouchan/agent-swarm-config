# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Environment Overview

This is a development home directory containing multiple independent projects, primarily focused on AI agents, cryptocurrency/Solana trading bots, and automation tools.

**Key projects:**
- `solana-trade-bot/` - Solana trading bot
- `crypto-ai-hedge-fund/` - AI-powered cryptocurrency hedge fund
- `eliza-starter/` - Eliza AI agent starter project
- `ZerePy/` - AI agent framework
- `OpenManus/` - Python-based AI agent project
- `bet-scan-scheduler/` - Betting scanner/scheduler
- `Channy-AI/` - AI assistant with src/ directory
- `CascadeProjects/` - Contains rapteegenerator and virattt-ai-hedge-fund

## Development Environment

**Languages & Runtimes:**
- Node.js (located at `/usr/local/bin/node`)
- Python 3 (located at `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3`)
- npm global packages installed to `~/.npm-global/bin`

**Root-level dependencies:**
- Node: `openai`, `solana-agent-kit`
- Dev tools: TypeScript, pyright (Python type checker)

## Working with Projects

**Navigation:**
Each subdirectory is a separate project with its own dependencies and build process. Always `cd` into the specific project directory before running commands.

**Common patterns:**
- Node.js projects: Look for `package.json` and use `npm install`, `npm run build`, `npm test`
- Python projects: Look for `requirements.txt`, `main.py`, or `setup.py`. Use `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Check individual project READMEs for specific setup and run instructions

## Important Notes

- This home directory is tracked as a git repository (unusual setup)
- LM Studio CLI tools available at `~/.lmstudio/bin`
- When working on a specific project, always navigate to that project's directory first
- Each project likely has different environment variable requirements (check for `.env` or `.env.example` files)
